 <h1>FAQ & Credits</h1>

 <!--
 <h3>Here are some questions we imagine game players might have after playing the game. We are also interested in your actual questions, so feel free to reach out to our team using the contact page.</h3>

 <p>1. Question: Why do I lose the game if someone dies? I would prefer to continue playing if that occurs, and to simply decide who to sacrifice so that the rest of the group may survive.</p>

 <p> Answer: Bhandary’s theory, from which the game derives, argues that in a just society everyone must receive the care they need to survive. The society these astronauts emerged from understands that care needs must be met. Therefore, this claim, and normative judgement, was a modeling constraint built into the structure of the game. The claim is informed by a form of ethics called Care Theory (see below for a subset of representative works).</p>

 <p> 2. Question: Why don’t you instruct players to distribute caregiving responsibilities fairly at the beginning of the game?</p>

 <p> Answer: In our society today, people do not always think about who is providing care, and some people end up being called upon to care for others in ways that sacrifice their own well-being. We think a helpful way to develop better ethical judgements is to gain insight into our assumptions, and the game is a work of practical philosophy, prompting its players to think about who is asked to care for others’ needs, as well as about how those expectations are connected to broader systems of social cooperation. The theory that informs these claims comes from sociologist Patricia Hill Collins’s theory that identifies how the stereotype of the “mammy” can constrain and control the lives of black women (2000). Bhandary’s work extends Collins’s insight to evaluate how stereotypes shape who we think should be a caregiver, as well as who expects that they should receive care without giving it.</p>

 <p> 3. Question: Why do they have to repair the ship? Why can’t the federation just send another ship?</p>

 <p>Answer: We wanted players to be involved in decision-making that includes tradeoffs to model that fact that people have to cooperate to achieve a variety of ends in real societies.</p>

 <p>4. Question: Why did you locate the game in space?</p>

 <p>Answer: Science fiction has a long tradition of showing possible arrangements for societies by obtaining distance from our assumptions about what is necessarily the case in our lived reality. We think such distance is needed to understand the embedded nature of care in our existing cultures and social forms. The other reason the game’s setting is in space is because the developers are sci-fi geeks as well as political philosophers and feminist ethicists.</p>

<p> 5. Question: Why do the characters have different abilities?</p>

<p> Answer: The characters’ differences in abilities plays the function of conveying the idea that real people have different kinds of care skills. The idea that caregiving is intellectual, and highly skilled, was articulated in Sara Ruddick’s pathbreaking work in her book Maternal Thinking (1989). This is one place where the way people are modeled differs from Bhandary’s philosophical position, which is that people who do not have caregiving skills should be taught the skills of attentiveness and responsiveness in school because our competency in caregiving is not immutable. Ultimately, we made a modeling decision to include the nonideal constraints of the real world rather than the ideal world we’re working toward, where people should have broader competencies in these different skills.</p>

<p>6. Question: Isn’t the game a little too individualistic for a theory about care? After all, doesn’t care ethics focus on our caring relationships, and offer a view of selves as relational (see, for instance, Held (2006).</p>

<p>Answer: Although the people we care about are very important to us - we think it is important to track human beings as separate because it is always an individual, or individuals in a group, who care for others.
</p>

<p> Our hope is that philosophers and care theorists use this game as an educational tool, to prompt debate and probe disagreements about its modeling assumptions. We also hope it is used by wide range of people with curious minds. Overall, we seek to prompt broader conversations about the role of care in our societies. If the game’s goal were to be distilled to its most important aim, it is to make distributions of caregiving visible, and as such, it is based on Bhandary’s “arrow of care map” a concept first published in FPQ.</p>

<p>Although Freedom to Care: Liberalism, Dependency Care, and Culture is the philosophical origin of the game, the book’s theory of distributive departs from the game in several ways. For instance, the value of autonomy is central to Bhandary’s theory, whereas in the game, third-person control means that individuals are not making their own choices. We decided to show the third-person, or birds-eye, view to show how decisions need to result in the outcome of meeting care needs. Bhandary’s own view is that theories of justice need to be informed by an understanding of the distribution of benefits and burdens, where these benefits and burdens must include the human need to receive care. As a liberal theorist, though, she also argues that a range of additional factors bear on individual choice and agency.</p>

<h3> Credits:</h3>

<p> Asha Bhandary was the principal investigator on this project with co-authors Laura Brown, Jamie Ritzo, Timothy Sommers.</p>

<p> The design of the game involved philosophical work sessions about how to model claims, what to include, and how to avoid racist pitfalls in depicting others while simultaneously prompting users to think about race and our assumptions about care. The endeavor of translating a work of political philosophy into a video game was substantially informed by Laura’s doctoral dissertation about the use of models in political philosophy.
</p>

<p> Laura made a critical breakthrough by creating prototype board game with cardboard and markers one weekend during the development stage. Tim Sommers wrote and recorded the introductory narrative about the Oort Cloud. Jamie distilled modeling claims from Freedom to Care. As UI Studio Senior Scholar, Deborah Whaley offered valuable consultation about the theoretically rich nature of digital animation of racial identities. I would also like to thank Judith Pasco, Leah Morlan, and Tom Keegan urging me to pursue a Studio project based on my work. Nikki White’s involvement began during those early meetings in 2016 and continued through completion of the project in 2021. We are grateful for the UI Digital Publishing Studio’s support throughout the process, including, crucially, Ethan DeGross’s programming and website design. The UI Philosophy Department generously supported a game testing session by our chapter of Minorities and Philosophy, and we thank MAP and the members of the philosophy community who participated in that session. We are also indebted to Professor Bhandary’s Feminist Ethics students for feedback on the game’s playability. Finally, board game prototype pieces were the gift of a donor who wishes to remain anonymous.</p>
